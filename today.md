Dear [DevOps Lead] and [Infrastructure Manager],

I hope this message finds you well.

On behalf of the Middleware Engineering team, I am reaching out to formally request the enablement of GitHub Actions for our team’s use within the enterprise GitHub environment.

Attached to this email are two supporting documents:

GitHub Actions vs Jenkins Analysis – This evaluates common concerns raised about GitHub Actions and compares them with the Jenkins CI/CD model currently in use.

Middleware Team GitHub Actions Justification – This outlines our team’s technical readiness, the specific middleware platforms we manage (including IBM MQ, Apache Kafka, and WebSphere), and the security and infrastructure controls we plan to implement for self-hosted runners.

We believe GitHub Actions will significantly enhance our CI/CD workflows while aligning with our DevSecOps strategy, modern developer experience goals, and internal security policies. The Middleware team is confident in our ability to host scalable, secure runners within our network and enforce controlled use of GitHub Actions through validated workflows and plugins.

We welcome an opportunity to meet with you and any relevant stakeholders to walk through our plan and address any questions or concerns.

Thank you for considering our request, and we look forward to your guidance on the next steps.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
