“Hi, it’s great to meet you. I’m [Your Name], and I’ll be part of your interview panel today.
Just to give you a quick background about myself — I’ve been in the IT space for over a decade now, with a strong focus on DevOps and infrastructure automation.
Currently, I work as a Senior Infrastructure Engineer, and while my primary focus is around Elasticsearch and observability platforms, I’m still deeply involved in Kubernetes — particularly around building proof of concepts, automation workflows, and architecture reviews.
I’m always excited to connect with engineers who bring strong integration and platform experience, especially across MQ, ACE, Kafka, and DevOps. So I’m looking forward to hearing more about your journey today and diving into some of your projects.”

Candidate-Specific Interview Questions (Based on Resume Timeline & Roles)
Q1. So what are you currently working on and can you describe what a regular work day is like?

Q5. You had this line on your resume “Utilized AWS Services such as EC2, EBS, SNS, ELB and Auto Scaling to build highly dependable, highly scalable, cost effective applications without creating or configuring the underlying AWS infrastructure”. What kind of applications did you build on AWS and how did you implement scaling?
Q6. You mentioned being involved in load balancing, tuning, and clustering for WebSphere Application Server environments. Can you walk us through a real-world scenario where you implemented or optimized a WebSphere cluster?
Specifically, I'd like to hear about:
•	What type of load balancer was used and how traffic routing was handled
•	Any performance tuning you applied (JVM settings, session replication, connection pools)
•	And how you ensured high availability and failover

Q7. In your experience working with JBoss, did you use Gradle or Maven to build your applications? Can you walk us through the full process — from building the .war or .ear file to deploying it on JBoss?
Also, how did you manage environment-specific configurations, and was the deployment automated or manual?
Q. 8 You mentioned working with the ELK stack — can you walk us through how you integrated ELK with JBoss or WebLogic?
Specifically:
•	How were logs collected and shipped to Logstash or Elasticsearch?
•	Did you configure Filebeat, or use any log forwarding agents?
•	How did you structure the logs for better searchability in Kibana?
Q9. Where do you see your career evolving in the next 3–5 years? Are you looking to go deeper into integration tech, or more into cloud-native or leadership paths?
