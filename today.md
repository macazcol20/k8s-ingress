‚ÄúHi, it‚Äôs great to meet you. I‚Äôm [Your Name], and I‚Äôll be part of your interview panel today.

Just to give you a quick background about myself ‚Äî I‚Äôve been in the IT space for over a decade now, with a strong focus on DevOps and infrastructure automation.

Currently, I work as a Senior Infrastructure Engineer, and while my primary focus is around Elasticsearch and observability platforms, I‚Äôm still deeply involved in Kubernetes ‚Äî particularly around building proof of concepts, automation workflows, and architecture reviews.

I‚Äôm always excited to connect with engineers who bring strong integration and platform experience, especially across MQ, ACE, Kafka, and DevOps. So I‚Äôm looking forward to hearing more about your journey today and diving into some of your projects.‚Äù
