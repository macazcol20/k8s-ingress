My goal is to assist the XXX realize
Operations and Service and Strategic Initiatives with elasticsearch.
Some of the initiatives I will be engaging on Integrate Ansible Tower with Elasticsearch to centralize automation runbook logs and enable correlation with infrastructure metrics, improving incident triage and root cause analysis efficiency by 30% by end of Q3.
I am also leading the efforts to integrate Elasticsearch with ServiceNow for ITOM and ITSM use cases, enabling real-time ingestion of alerts and infrastructure telemetry into CMDB and incident workflows, delivering a unified view for operations by end of Q2.
- I will also be working  alongside my mates to strengthen internal knowledge in the Elasticsearch space and promote a culture of technical excellence.
- Also on my continious improvement time, I will use that time wisely to deploy new technologies like the Vault server and the storing of sensitive credentials and pissible the automation of certificates.
  - I will also find time inbetween my schedule to lear new skills, I am interested in gaining more knowledge in the space of AI, because I understand how important this will become in the future.
